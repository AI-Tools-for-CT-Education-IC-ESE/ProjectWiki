##Activities:

1. Student journey and Imperial existing content mapping
  - Taxonomy for Computational Thinking (Maths + Comp Sci + Coding) - what are the key topics, what builds on what?
  - What is a typical Imperial student journey (UG vs Masters vs graduate research)
  - How much repetition/commonality is there is teaching journey and modules:
    - What is an average department, what are the outliers?
    - Where are the opportunities for co-teaching (e.g. ESE + Material co-delivering Intro Python to a larger class size; designing common pre-sessional material)


2. Pedagogy research questions
  - What is the distribution of student skill levels:
    - Is a normal distribution anything like reality?
    - Is the area of CT more likely to have something closer to a double hump? Does grade distribution (easy to obtain) reflect incoming and outgoing skill level (hard to obtain)
  - What can be done to improve student journey/outcomes
  - What is the value proposition for personalisation?
  - What does personalisation mean in terms of pre-requisites, assessments etc: huge flexibility within module vs little flexibility between modules

3. AI research questions and chatbot deployment
  - Back-end and deployment questions
    - Including cost
  - Trustworthiness
  - AI study partners vs AI assessment
  - AI content creation/tailoring
  - AI translation of material targeting one science/engineering discipline into material appropriate for another
  - AI creation of exercises/examples

4. Creation of central database of material
  - ESE Primer
  - Samraat Life Sciences material
  - Graduate School coding and data science
  - Maths incoming UG pre-sessional material

5. Looking up and down: Schools, CPD, lifelong learning

## Success Metrics

1. Internal reports/white papers
  - Analysis of overlaps in departmental CT teaching
  - Commonalities in student journeys
2. Conference papers
3. Journal papers
4. "users" and "developers" from other departments
